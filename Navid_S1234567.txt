My name is Navid with matrix number, S1234567. I am
majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling great about taking this
subject. This is because I love to learn more about data structure.
I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will need to study hard. Wish me luck!!!!
